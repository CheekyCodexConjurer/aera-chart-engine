# Architecture

Rationale: Architecture map for the chart-engine repo; quant-lab keeps its own maps.

This file is index-only. For details, use:
- `.agent-docs/architecture.md` - low-context architecture map (read first)
- `docs/architecture-overview.md` - architecture overview and invariants
- `docs/INDEX.md` - canonical docs index
