# Do Not Copy from quant-lab

## Must remain in quant-lab docs
- Indicator authoring rules and Python runner details.
- UI layout, menus, and app-specific state management.
- Host-specific workflow logic and component design.

## Allowed to adopt
- Contract-first documentation discipline.
- No indicator hardcoding in the renderer.
- Documentation sync and drift control practices.
