# Roadmap Governance

## Why it matters
- The roadmap is the execution contract between engine owners and host integrators.
- Vague milestones create drift and hidden scope creep.
- Quant workflows require explicit dependencies, budgets, and verification gates.

## What good looks like
- Each milestone has measurable deliverables, DoD, risks, and dependencies.
- Every task references a spec in `docs/roadmap/` or a canonical contract doc.
- Performance, determinism, and observability are specified with numbers.
- Host boundaries are explicit and never blurred in roadmap tasks.
- ROADMAP updates are synchronized with `docs/roadmap/INDEX.md`.

## Common failure modes
- Tasks without numeric budgets or pass/fail criteria.
- Missing links to specs, leaving work open to interpretation.
- Mixing host responsibilities into engine milestones.
- Marking milestones complete without updating contracts and gates.
- Letting the legacy backlog drift from the executable roadmap.
