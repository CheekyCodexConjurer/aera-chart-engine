# Bootstrap Sources

Follow AGENTS.md first; use this list as fallback or for discovery.

## Governance and architecture
- AGENTS.md
- .agent-docs/architecture.md
- architecture.md
- docs/roadmap/INDEX.md
- docs/INDEX.md

## Skills indexes
- .agent-docs/SKILLS.md
- skills.md
- docs/skills/INDEX.md

## Local Codex skills
- skills/*/SKILL.md

## Notes
- If AGENTS.md points to specific indexes, use those first.
- Keep context small: read only the leaf docs you need.
